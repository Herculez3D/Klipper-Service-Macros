# 🔧 Klipper Toolhead Service & Nozzle-Change Macros

This repository provides a set of Klipper macros that automate and
simplify common 3D-printer maintenance tasks, including nozzle changes,
cold swaps, and general toolhead servicing. The macros park the toolhead
front-and-center for easy access, guide the user through each step with
on-screen prompts, movement, retraction, LED control, and
heater management automatically.

## 🧩 Macro Overview

### Service_Position

Prepares the printer for maintenance:
- Homing if its gotta
- Moves Toolhead to service position
- Filament retraction
- Displays start prompts

### Nozzle Swap

A fully guided hot-nozzle change:
- Prompts user to heat, loosen, and install new nozzle
- Optioinal extra extrusion or retraction for flushing

If using a cold swap nozzle:
- Uses machine partcooling fans to assist with cooldown 
- Prompts user to change nozzle after minium temp is reached

chmod +x service_macros_installer.sh
bash ./service_macros_installer.sh install
```

Running this command will automatically install all files along with adding update manager to your `moonraker.conf`

Add `[include ServiceSettings.cfg]` to your `printer.cfg`


### After installation, Mainsail will show:

```
printer_data/config/
│
├── ServiceSettings.cfg          ← Editable settings
│
└── ServiceMacros/               ← Folder
      ├── ServiceMacros.cfg
      └── ServiceSettings.cfg    (template only)
